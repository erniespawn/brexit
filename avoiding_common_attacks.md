# Avoiding Common Attacks

## Reentrancy attack
Reentrancy attack is prevented by modifying the status of the entry before actually processing the transfer.

```
bountyEntry.status = BountyEntryStatus.Paid;
(bounty.token).safeTransfer(bountyEntry.entryUser, bounty.payout);
```

## Integer Overflow and Underflow
I have used the SafeMath.sol library from [OpenZeppelin](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/blob/master/contracts/math/SafeMath.sol). The library implements safety checks on mathematical functions that reverts on error.

## Denial of Service
Denial of service attack is prevented by using a withdrawal pattern.

## Avoiding Common Attacks


### Reentrancy ‚û∞
We are using the withdrawl pattern in the Smart Contract. The withdraw function is a used by user to withdraw their funds. By using the transfer() function instead of call.value() we limit the amount of wei transmitted to any fallback function.


### Integer overflows/underflows üî¨
Used the awesome [SafeMath](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/) contract for this. 

### DDoS üíª
We are using the pull over push payments method and thus it protects against the threat of DDoS.


### Timestamping / miner tampering ‚è≤Ô∏è
We have not touched the timestamps of any block and hence it protects us from minor tampering with the blocks.


### Owner Profile üïµÔ∏è
The constructor initializes the owner's profile using their address so in case something goes wrong one can kill the contract and remove it from the blockchain with all the funds remaining safe.


### Bugs üêõ
In case any bugs are detected in the contract, we can freeze the contract and fix them without incorporating heavy damage while the bug is being fixed.


### Contract lifecycle

Owner of the contract can terminate the contract using kill-function, that removes the code from blockchain and return funds.
